### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm SK, I work in IT and enjoy learning a range of digital skills. I am currently learning Javascript & Python occassionally working on some personal/hobby projects but for the moment nothing advanced or serious. Most of my projects will be hosted by [Caerus Online](https://github.com/Caerus-Online/.github). I also work on repairing phones when possible.
